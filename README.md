# Sang

A simple Angular Service and Directive for building custom SoundCloud players

## Tests

Run all specs:

```
$ grunt jasmine
```

You can also run `grunt watch` to run specs whenever source or spec files change.

## TODO

1. Resolve SoundCloud playlists to actual track data
2. Add event listeners on the internal `Player`
3. Directive
4. Separate out `AudioPlayer` provider
